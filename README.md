[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-demo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-demo)

In this sample application, you're engaging with a banking virtual assistant. The assistant simulates a few scenarios, such as making a credit card payment, booking an appointment with a banker and choosing a credit card. Watson can understand your entries and respond accordingly.

## Prerequisites

1. Sign up for an [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration).
1. Download the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli/index.html#overview).
1. Create an instance of the Watson Assistant service and get your credentials:
    - Go to the [Watson Assistant][service_url] page in the IBM Cloud Catalog.
    - Log in to your IBM Cloud account.
    - Click **Create**.
    - Click **Show** to view the service credentials.
    - Copy the `apikey` value.
    - Copy the `url` value.

## Configuring the application

1. In the application folder, copy the *.env.example* file and create a file called *.env*

    ```
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2. Open the *.env* file and add the service credentials that you obtained in the previous step.

    Example *.env* file that configures the `apikey` and `url` for a Watson Assistant service instance hosted in the US East region:

    ```
    ASSISTANT_IAM_APIKEY=X4rbi8vwZmKpXfowaS3GAsA7vdy17Qh7km5D6EzKLHL2
